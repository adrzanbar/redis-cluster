# the secret should contain the openstack credentials
# there are several options to inject the credentials:
# 1) from kubernetes secret that doesn't exist: set "enabled" and "create" to true, this will create a secret from the values written to "data" down below
# 2) from kubernetes secret that already exists: set "enabled" to true and "create" to false
# 3) from host system path /etc/cloud/cloud.conf: set "enabled" to false and "hostMount" to true
# 4) via agent-injector (e.g. hashicorp vault): set "enabled" and "hostMount" to false, you have to provide credentials on your own by injecting credentials into the pod
